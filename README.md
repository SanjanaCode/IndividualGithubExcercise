## Sorting elements in an array

### **Feature 1**: Sort a list of integers

The program will sort an array of integers in ascending order. The method `intSort()` in the class `SortArray` takes the unsorted array as the argument and sorts the array using the concept of the bubble sort algorithm. It then returns the sorted integer array.

### **Feature 2**: Sort a list of strings

The program will sort an array of strings in ascending order. The method `strSort()` in the class `SortArray` takes the unsorted array as the argument and sorts the array using the concept of the bubble sort algorithm using the predefined `compareToIgnoreCase()` method in order to order the strings lexicographically (without considering case differences). It then returns the sorted string array.
